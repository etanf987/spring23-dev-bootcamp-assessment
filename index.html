            <p class="profile-text"> Ethan is a first-year Computer Science student at Georgia Tech.
                He is from Cleveland, Ohio, home of the Guardians, Browns, and other horrors beyond comprehension.
                He loves to teach and tutor people, which he did avidly in high school, through his high school and church.
                He tutored kids from any grade in the subjects he was confident in free of charge.
                He also finds it fulfilling to use physical work to help others, whether it was at a missions trip with his youth group or with the Cleveland Food Bank.
                For fun, he plays tennis, does origami, and hangs out with family and friends. He also loves to eat.
